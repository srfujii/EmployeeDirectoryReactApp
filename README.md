  ## Description

  This front-end React JS web application is a quick-access searchable and sortable Employee Directory. Employees and managers benefit greatly by being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees, especially when they can filter by categories and search by name. This React web app allows users to sort employees by name, and to search for specific employess by name. It uses React components to manage state and respond to user events.
